                <p>I have been studying in programming for 6 years, since my first day of
 undergrad life. I haven't realized it has been so long, this studying life
 already took away most of my youth. I was a kid without knowing the toughness
 of life, to a young man need to worry about jobs and how to start having
 family.</p>
<p>The computer industry changed vastly in this period. There was no Cloud
Computing, Machine Learning was only known in Academics. Universities taught
students how to code in VC++. Now everything is different.</p>
<p>What was my path? Well, 5 years ago, a friend of mine taught me how to install
Linux on a laptop, it all started there. Firstly it was Debian and Ubuntu,
Debian was at version 5 and it did not even support WPA2 encryption.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">Why my laptop cannot connect to WI-FI?</span><span class="s2">"</span>,
    <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">My X.org crashed again after I installed the proprietary graphics</span>
    <span class="nv">driver</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">,</span>
    <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">I ran that script, I don't know what is going on in the manual, it</span>
    <span class="nv">should</span> <span class="nv">work</span>, <span class="nv">right</span>?<span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">.</span>
    <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">How to get my speaker to work, I installed Alsa already</span><span class="s2">"</span>.
</pre></div>
<p>I switched between Debian and Ubuntu for several times before I followed the
installation guide of Arch Linux :p.</p>
<p>I started to live under a terminal with 'grep', 'cd', 'ls', 'find', 'cat',
etc. Then there is the story of how-to-vim. Adapting to hjkl, Esc and i, then
you tried to copy other people's vim script, how to use ctags with vim, how to
use YouCompleteMe. Writing dozen vim code without knowing why. VimScript is a
hell of hack anyway. So my system was basically terminals with editors and a
browser.</p>
<p>Wait, I haven't talked anything about programming yet,  should I started at
"hello world"? No, lets started at CSAPP (if you haven't read it yet, you really
need to, it is a good book), you know there is a stack and a heap in your
memory, and modern systems use "flat addressing", between these two, people
found there are still some space for shared libraries. Every instruction that
CPU executes follow the same pipeline, and I can actually execute multiple
instructions simultaneously. Do you want your program to hit the cache every
time? Just joking.</p>
<p>But you won't be able to find a job with C, right? Why the hell would any
company would want employees to code in C? 2010s, it is all about javascript,
this has been true for almost 6 years, I still haven't start learn
javascript. But at least, I learned Python. Really, first time I did something
besides computing and digits.</p>
<p>2012, it was just the time of machine learning, python was the first few
languages that developed libraries with it.  Numpy and Scipy, strangely, they
were the first two libs I used just after the night I learned python(You can
learn python in one night, it is true). That was just 2 years ago.</p>
<p>Before I even realized my undergraduate life ended, the graduated offer came to
my hand. I don't know what's ahead of me. But anyway, I was young.</p>
<p>With a full head of unknowns, I flew to Canada. No more undergrad type of large
classes, what you have in graduate life is just small classes and
deadlines. Gee, they really passed so fast.</p>
<p>2016, I am in a Computer Vision lab now, just recalled the path I walked, just
realized that my youth almost ends.</p>
