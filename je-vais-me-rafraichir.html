                <p>If one can really pull off his inner energy, I guess I already overdrafted
it. Well, I get these feelings from time to times. Like the days when I paced in
the laborary depressed by the research or the recent weeks I was torturing
myself learning French to a new level. I told myself, pull out inner energy and
rush through. But this is illusions, what I really had was a kind of isolation
and this pace of life, sadly, it forms the pieces of my life. When I try to look
back in the path, I don't try very often, but when I do, these repeated pattern
seems want to tell me I was working on some setted up tasks, lasting ones. They
are created so I can seamlessly pass time, fill out my life and grow old whitout
notice, and they have the same name as well, Education.</p>
<p>Growing old is one of those things which scares me, it is also the idea I
wouldn't think of back in 3 years ago. I was like one of those kids like to
imaging the future, Machine Learning will replace 90 percent programming labor;
Aids is curable and ... Big ideas, big ideas. But I can't draw the details of my
future self, how he will pass Januaries and Augsts. I can't neither imaging or
remember. Days passed, and I am older and older. The man I wished to become, I
am not him, and I am not who I was either, now I am reading the first blog I
published but I don't feel it was writen by my hand. I have to say, this is a
strange, sad truth: I can't keep what I had or foresee what I will be. All I
have is right here, right now, then this Sichem is gone, forever. I am not who I
was and I am not who I will be.</p>
<p>Now I finally realize. "Qu'elle est courte la vie". Time takes away everything
and it kicks me forward regardless. So before it chase me up, here I am writing
to you, my future self. N'importe si tu te apporte la même sentiment. Remember
that we are different, treat this like some old friend who wrote you, I wish you
live well, I wish you are happy in the state you are, that is all that
matters. I have made all those plan for you to finish because I couldn't finish
it. When you are struggling you know that is not you, that was me. I would
rather you are just enjoy the moment but I am greedy to be who I am not. I am
carring the guilt to push off all my problems to you so I need to take the
responsibility to live up to my younger self's expectations, I don't blame him
for leaving his wishes to me, but if I leave the same problems to you. I fear
that this guilt will pass to you as well. I don't want your sorries.</p>
<p>I am taking a moment, losing my focus when I am watching tiny dust is falling on
the keyboard in front of the lamp. It is like this moment will never pass. But I
couldn't, tommorrow is calling my name.</p>
<p>All the best.</p>
