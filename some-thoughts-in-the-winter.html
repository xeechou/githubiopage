                <p>If one can really pull off his inner energy, I guess I've overdrawn it. Right, I
get these wearing sentiment from time to times, like the days when I paced in
the laboratory, depressed by the research, like more recent weeks I am learning
3 hours French after full-time job. I told myself, pull out inner energy and
rush through. But this is illusions, what I really had was a kind of isolation
and this pace of life, sadly, it forms the pieces of my life. When I try to look
back in the path, I don't try very often, but when I do, these repeated pattern
seems want to tell me I was working on some set up tasks, lasting ones. They are
created so I can seamlessly pass time, fill out my life and grow old without
notice, and they have the same name as well, Education.</p>
<p>Growing old starts to scare me, it is the idea I wouldn't think of back in
3 years ago. I was like one of those kids like to imaging the great future,
Machine Learning will replace 90 percent programming labor; Aids is curable and
maybe we will leaving earth to start colonize Mars.. But I can't draw the
details of my future self, how he will pass Januaries and August. I can't
neither imaging or remember. I am older and older. The man I wished to become, I
am not him, and I am not who I was either, now I am reading the first blog I
published but I don't feel it was written by my hand. I have to say, this is a
strange and sad truth: I can't keep what I had or foresee what I will be. All I
have is right here, right now, then this me is gone, forever.</p>
<p>Now I finally realize. I am not who I was and I am not who I will be. Time takes
away everything and it kicks you forward regardless. So before it chase me up,
here I am writing to you, my future self. Remember that we are different, treat
me like some old friend who wrote you, I wish you live well, I wish you are
happy in the state you are. I have made all those plan for you to finish because
I couldn't finish them. When you are struggling you know that is not you, that
was me. I would rather you are just enjoy the moment but I am greedy to be who I
am not. I am carrying the guilt to push off all my problems to you so I need to
take the responsibility to live up to expectation of the younger me.</p>
<p>All the best.</p>
