                <p>Five months ago, when I just failed my first French test, I wrote the last
journal, with full of my emotions and sorrow. c'était l'hiver, the freezing
temperature and heavy snow bring the depressions. Now the two are gone, at
least for the quit a few months, and the depression stayed. Some weeks are
better and other weeks are worse, if I have to say, the black dog has been
chasing  me, better days when I focused on something else, worse days come when
there is too much me living inside me, THIS SUCKS.</p>
<p>Life never went what I thought it to be, but when I was younger, there seems
always hopes, possibilities churned up the reality, I turned to brag to myself
and my poor memory only reminds me when it was too late. Well, Since I was the
guy who caused it, forgiveness was given easily. All those images seemed inches
out of my finger, learning the new nature/programming language, learn music,
midis, refine my computational geometry knowledge, being more socialized and
likable. I claimed these are easy, well, now I think of it, the reality teaches
me "watching Netflix with beer and wasting time on cellphones" are the real easy
things, what a disappointment of reality.</p>
<p>The image of the slightly better version of myself, it seems that he can live a
much better life and pursuit the success. It is feasible, he really requires not
superpowers or being rich as Bruce Wayne. But yet, this super-version of myself
is 100 steps ahead of me everyday. Well, in details, I guess he would not feel
sleepy anytime during the day, has a urge to eat something from time to time or
open YouTube pages from time to times when stuck in thought or bugs. He would
somehow have energy and find the time to keep studying computational
photography, graphics algorithm or even the music theories which I promised
myself. Are all the inertia destroying my life, leading me to an unpleasant,
boring life? But it does scare me. It reminds me of the depressed version of
Peter Parker, never became Spider-Man, never was able to get Mary Jane. is in
reality that most of us are that boring Peter Parker?</p>
<p>If only I can keep this mentality forever. Unfortunately on Mondays, Tuesdays,
some voices in my head would start whispering again. "Come on, you can start
watching Netflix, forget about all the tasks, and things you want to do. You can
always do it tomorrow, Just waste your time on Netflix for next 2 hours, the
dopamine will be happy."</p>
<p>Well, no answers.</p>
