                <p>If there is one thing I'd like to commit it must be the my time mangement
improvements. For that purpose, Emacs Org-mode is the <strong>ultimate</strong> tool for
programmers. I can keep my notes nicely and I can track my tasks/errands all
together. From time to times, I was always on-and-off with using org-mode due
to the portability, we are not on the same computer all the time anymore, and
potentially I would like to track my TODOs from cellphone as well.</p>
<p>A long time ago my tooling of choice was <strong>git</strong>. It seems the perfect tool,
optimised for text tracking, and potentially we can use it for text
merging. Mannually typing <code>git add *</code>, <code>git commit</code> all the time is annoying,
luckly we can do that with a script.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># sync everything</span>
git pull<span class="p">;</span>
git add *<span class="p">;</span>
git commit -m <span class="s2">"</span><span class="k">$(</span>date<span class="k">)</span><span class="s2">"</span>
git push
</code></pre></div>
<p>While this is doable on the linux box, on cellphone it is not the most
convenient thing, I had to open pocket git, pull, resolve conflicts, then on
Orgzly, sync with git folder again. everytime I commit would have to pull
immediately on the cellphone to avoid conflicts otherwise there weare always
conflicts for some reason.</p>
<p><strong>Syncthing</strong> was the another try, it is decentralized, you can use it to
synchronize any file from different computers given that we are online,
eventially they would be synchronized. Its decentralized nature is both the
good and evil here, I don't have to connect/trust to any server. My files are
with me and only with me. But then I have to keep my devices online for
synchronize. It is obviously not the case.</p>
<p>Then I turned to Webdav, at the moment, the best solution among all, given that
I can find a Webdav server close-enough. Nextcloud providers are the best
choices, sadly all of them are far away from me. Setting up my own nextcloud on
a nextcloud is an overkill and much more expensive than necessary. Luckly at
where I am, there is a free option, fast enough (only 10ms from me) but a
little confusing to setup. </p>
<p>The Webdav server used requires the following options to turn on for mounting
davfs:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1">#sample from davfs2.conf</span>
if_match_bug        <span class="m">1</span> <span class="c1">#otherwise cannot write via davfs </span>
ignore_dav_header   <span class="m">1</span> <span class="c1">#otherwise davfs failing connect to the server</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>At the first I could not mount the davfs. Based on what people posted online,
this specific webdav server generates wrong capabilities and requires
<code>ignore_dav_header</code> set for mounting. Then just when I was happy about finding
a fast webdav server, I found out I cannot write to the davfs mount point. It
bugged a whole day, disabling the cache, disabling the delay, nothing works. I
was about to give up, falling back using <strong>cadaver</strong> util. I found out folks on
<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/davfs2/+bug/466960">launchpad</a> were
experiencing the same problem. Given nothing else works, I just gave it a try
and it was like magic. This serves as a warning, DO NOT expect the private web
service you are using works as expected.</p>
<p>This is probably the last block on my way. Now I can sync the note by one
guesture on the phone. For summng up, on desktop:</p>
<ol>
<li>mount the webdav server using davfs.</li>
<li>Work, coding, capturing on emacs as usual.</li>
<li>umounting once away from keyboard.</li>
</ol>
<p>on cellphone:
1. open the APP, drag to sync,
2. performing org operations if necessary.
3. tap to sync again.</p>
<p>Directly editing remote files maybe laggy in emacs if the server is far
away. For that reason, in the future, I may write a lisp function for <code>pulling</code>
and <code>pushing</code> on emacs as well. <em>Orglzy</em> is my current mobile app of choice. It
is not the most pretty one but supports editing, if not require editing,
<em>Orgro</em> supports more syntax highlighting. <em>Organice</em> is another Webapp I can
use but unfortunately not compatible with my current webdav server.</p>
