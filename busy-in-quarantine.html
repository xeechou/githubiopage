                <p>I update this blog less frequent than once per year, which sometimes makes me
question why do I keep paying for this site. Be able to update blogs is always
my pursuit, unfortunately there were always more code to write. It has been more
than one year, last time I was still on how to MSAA on OpenGL 4, somehow it felt
like a decade ago. The peaceful developing world took an interesting turn. A
long run bull market is killed and NYSE triggered circuit break 4 times in 10
days. People are joking they now have 75% of Warren Buffet's experience. Will
this gonna be the story we told our grand children born after 2020? "You know
back in 2020, it was a crazy year...". We just saw the quarter of it, I am kind
of expecting the crazier in the rest, will it be massive unemployment and a
scary recession will be waiting? This week the market has recovered a bit of its
confidence somehow, despite the Covid-19 cases are surging. A friend used to
tell me, it would be a point where many will be killed by the virus and people
just don't care anymore, looks like the market is at that point.</p>
<p>It is the third week I am at home quarantine, but it has been a busy ride. I
never got the chance to actually have this much free time to work on my own
interest. Well, I merged 4 branches for <a href="https://taiwins.org">taiwins</a> so far.
shockingly, it actually has this much work to do, if not this quarantine time, I
probably will never have this much progress. It was supposed be finished in 2018
and I thought, "well, I should be finished soon", then 2019 passed, there I just
finished a console feature for launching applications and I had the second time
wishful thinking. Now in this year I had to add features like <strong>dbus</strong>,
<strong>tw_theme</strong>, it looks like necessary. I did not think a <code>dbus</code> feature toke me
a month to develop, nor did I think a <code>tw_theme</code> would cost 2 full weeks, not to
mention I have not yet finishing patching weston in upstream. All those toke
trumendous amount of time. At this point I feel lucky for the coronavirus
outbreak in someway, I wouldn't be able to advance this much in progress. In am
running out of time, in a few weeks I will be taking buses to work again. Then I
would be back on track on my proprietary software job.</p>
